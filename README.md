# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
 
## Overview

This analysis seeks to compare the frequency of five-star Amazon product reviews according to whether the reviewer was a member of Amazon's Vine paid reviewer service. This specific analysis is performed on a table of wristwatch reviews, chosen from several datasets available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt). The data was ETL'd with PySpark, and the analysis was performed in a Jupyter notebook with Pandas.

## Results

### The following analysis was performed only for reviews which met two conditions: >= 20 votes and >= 50% "helpful" votes
